Problem Statement:
A three digit number is said to be an “Armstrong number” if the sum of the third power of its 
individual digits is equal to the number itself.
Example: 371 is an Armstrong number as 371 = 3 3 + 7 3 + 1 3
              407 is an Armstrong number as 407 = 4 3 + 0 3 + 7 3
Write a pseudo-code to check whether a given three digit number is an Armstrong number.

Solution:
input Number
Temp=Number
Sum=0
while(Number!=0)do
Remainder=Number%10
sum=sum+Number*Number*Number
Number=Number/10
end-while
if(Temp==Sum)then
display"This is an Armstrong Number"
else
display"This is not an Armstrong Number"
end-if
