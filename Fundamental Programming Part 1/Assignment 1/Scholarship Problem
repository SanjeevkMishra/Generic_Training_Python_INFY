Problem Statement:JIT University offering degree courses to students has decided to provide scholarship based on the following details:

Branch of study	Score (%)	Scholarship %	Remarks
Arts	Score is at least 90	50	The student is eligible only for one scholarship% even if both the 
score conditions are valid for the given branch of study. In such cases, students are eligible for 
the highest scholarship% applicable among the two.
Arts	Score is an odd number	5
Engineering	Score is more than 85	50
Engineering	Score is divisible by 7	5If there are 500 students who have joined the university, 
write a pseudo-code to calculate and display the final fees to be paid by each student.
You may accept the branch of study, score and course fee as inputs for each student and calculate 
the final fees to be paid by each student based on formulae given below:
Scholarship amount=course fee * (scholarship%)
Final fee= course fee - scholarship amount

Solution:

for(counter=1,counter<=500,Counter=counter+1)
input Branch_of_Study,Score,Course_Fee
if(Branch_of_Study=="Arts")then
  if(Score>=90)then
    Scholarship=50
  else if(Score%2!=0)then
    Scholarship=5
  end-if
else if(Branch_of_study=="Engineering")then
  if(Score>85)then
    Scholarship=50
  else if(score%7==0)then
    Scholarship=5
  end-if
else 
  scholarship=0
end if
Scholarship_Amount=Course_Fee*scholarship/100
Final_Fee=Course_Fee*Scholarship/100
display Final_fee
end-while
