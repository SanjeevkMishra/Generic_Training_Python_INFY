Problem Statement:
Write a python program tofind and display the product of three positive integer values based on the 
rule mentioned below:
It should display the product of the three values except when one of the integer value is 7. In that
case, 7 should not be included in the product and the values to its left also should not be included.
If there is only one value to be considered, display that value itself. If no values can be included 
in the product, display -1.

def find_product(num1,num2,num3):
    product=0
    if num1==7:
      product=num2*num3
    elif num2==7:
      product=num3
    elif num3==7:
      product=-1
    else
    product=num1*num2*num3
    return product

#Provide different values for num1, num2, num3 and test your program
product=find_product(7,6,2)
print(product)
